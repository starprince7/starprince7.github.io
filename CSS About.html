                            Welcome! I owe you my thanks for being here, I'm glad u made it this far to the about section, with this little knowledge you've gotten so far, I guess it is safe to say you are among the few on earth to have been to the moon ...Lol.
                                Been a long year even with the recent outbreak of a pandemic that's put the whole world at the edge it hasn't been easy for anyone, parents, children the hustlers, most especially students in nigeria who have loads of complete syllables to uncover.
                                It has left alot of nigerian students frustrated, many moving on, trying to catch on with the daily struggle ...as they move forward with their lives indulging in several things to make sure they don't find them selves at a point, stagnated and not gaining or adding anything to them selves this has just been the current situation I find myself in having the feeling of not being productive enough made me feel useless, had to push my limits in challenging my self to take up a task that I have always felt to be complicated and mind warping. 
                                At most point I do feel drained of the energy and that drive that fuels me which is mostly as a result of factors beyond my capacity, I'll need the full support of people around me. All I want is to keep this fire burning, hopefully by the grace of God I should be able to make it to "September" which is the time stipulated duration I've got to achieving the first phase of my goals!
